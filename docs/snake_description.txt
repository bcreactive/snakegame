description:

use arrow-keys to control the snake!
collect as many fruits as possible, without having the snake collide with itself.
the snakes body grows by one segment for each collected fruit. 

a level-up is reached, if a certain amount of fruits is collected:
this will increase the speed and the collected fruits are worth more points.

bonus-fruits will spawn at a small chance, and disappear after a short time.
use shortcuts (wall-portation) to reach these, before the timer runs out! 
bonus-fruits are worth 1000 pts and provide a chance, to cut off the snakes last tail-segment.

try to get as many points as possible, to beat the current highscore!
